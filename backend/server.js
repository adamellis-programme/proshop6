// Static files are files that the server
// does not need to process or modifyâ€”files
// that are served directly as they are stored.

// path.join is used to create a normalized path by joining the current directory (__dirname) with the /uploads directory. This ensures that the server correctly resolves the path regardless of the operating system.
// For example, if your project directory is /home/user/project, this line will resolve the uploads directory as /home/user/project/uploads.

// make sure under all routes
